What is a micro bakery?
A micro bakery is a small-scale, home-based bakery you can legally run right from your home kitchen—no fancy equipment or prior baking experience required.

It's a low-cost and easy to manage business, so you can focus on the fun part, creating delicious treats that people can’t wait to get their hands on.

With a micro bakery, you can spend your free time baking fresh bread, cookies, and brownies, then sell your treats with a bread stand outside your home, at local farmers markets, or through pick-up and delivery—which is perfect for apartment dwellers.

Whether you’re looking to supplement your current income or dream of one day replacing it altogether, a micro bakery can fit right into your life and become the perfect little business for you.

Transform your kitchen into an honest-to-goodness business you legitimately love running...
All you need are the tools to build it and a guide to show you the way!


my bread ...
my sourdough breads are hand crafted & baked fresh daily, using sustainable whole grain flour, and a naturally leavened process, that makes them bread flavorful and nutritious.  
my approach...
Sourdough is a natural way of making bread through slow fermentation.  There is no short-cut: it is this evolving process - nurtured by the loving baker - that gives bread depth, body and flavor.
Small batch is how we do things at Bread Bites – from scratch, by hand, daily.  If sometimes all is sell out, is because I am  not a factory.
My breads are fermented for sixteen hours then baked at high temperature which results in a dark crust.  It is this caramelization from the bold bake, contrast with a creamy interior, that creates the perfect loaf.
Not all sourdoughs are created equal...
There is so much more to sourdough, which is afterall a method.  Much has yet to be asked about what goes into the bread - primarily, flour.  
Most of the flour in the market is commodity that is produced for extendable shelf life.  
I have chosen to work with good practices. From farmers and millers who grow and develop wheat, ray and barley that do not need dousing with chemicals, and mill the grain in such a way as to keep the nutrition intact.  
What’s the difference? By using such flour, I am able to produce a healthy and incredibly flavorful bread.
My breads are healthy and excellent for people who have issues with sugar levels.
Why does it matter? 
Food is medicine.
To be best in craft means that not only does the food have to taste good, but things should be done right.  It is important to strive to improve, to be mindful
